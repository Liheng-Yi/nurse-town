# nurse-town


The primary purpose of this project is to develop a nursing student training game named “Nurse Town” that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative graphics and texts to create an immersive virtual training game for nursing students. This game aims to simulate a wide range of clinical scenarios with high fidelity, allowing students to practice and hone their skills in a controlled yet realistic setting. By doing so, the project seeks to enhance the quality and accessibility of nursing education, ensure a more uniform training experience, and better prepare students for the complexities of real-world medical care.
